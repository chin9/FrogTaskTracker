# Frog Timer

## Project Proposal
As my personal project this term, I would like to design a task tracker (or pomodoro timer) 
that would record one's task after one has completed it. 
In order to make studying more appealing, a student can
help feed a frog every time they have completed a task. The frog will level up over time.
In addition, they can also see an overview of how much they have accomplished sorted by subject, 
task type, and date.

This application would be designed for students who may need a bit of extra 
motivation to get to work. As a student myself, I understand how stressful and 
overwhelming it can get during the school year. Furthermore, I believe that the 
pressure that comes with school can be a significant contributing factor to student procrastination.
Therefore, I hope that by *gamifying* studying and schoolwork, students can look 
forward to completing some of the more mundane or unappealing tasks.
